# Outline of the Basic Genetic Algorithm
1. Start
Generate random population of n chromosomes (suitable solutions for the problem)
2. Fitness
Evaluate the fitness f(x) of each chromosome x in the population
3. New population: Create a new population by repeating following steps until the new population is complete
    - Selection: Select two parent chromosomes from a population according to their fitness (the better fitness, the bigger chance to be selected)
    - Crossover: With a crossover probability cross over the parents to form a new offspring (children). If no crossover was performed, offspring is an exact copy of parents.
    - Mutation: With a mutation probability mutate new offspring at each locus (position in chromosome).
    - Accepting: Place new offspring in a new population
4. Replace Use new generated population for a further run of algorithm
5. Test If the end condition is satisfied, stop, and return the best solution in current population
6. Loop Go to step 2
